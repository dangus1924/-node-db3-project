-- Display the ProductName and CategoryName for all products in the database. Shows 77 records.
SELECT Product.ProductName, Category.CategoryName FROM Product
JOIN Category ON Product.CategoryId=Category.id
-- Display the order Id and shipper CompanyName for all orders placed before August 9 2012. Shows 429 records.
SELECT O.Id, Shipper.CompanyName  from "Order" as O
JOIN Shipper On O.ShipVia = Shipper.Id
where ShippedDate < "2012_08_09" 
-- Display the name and quantity of the products ordered in order with Id 10251. Sort by ProductName. Shows 3 records.
SELECT Product.ProductName, OrderDetail.Quantity FROM Product 
JOIN OrderDetail ON Product.Id = OrderDetail.ProductId
WHERE OrderDetail.OrderId = 10251
-- Display the OrderID, Customer's Company Name and the employee's LastName for every order. All columns should be labeled clearly. Displays 16,789 records.
SELECT O.Id, Customer.CompanyName, Employee.LastName from  "Order" as O 
-- the spec requires you to clearly lable the columns.  
-- The id column in particular needs to be labled. How would you do that?
JOIN Customer
ON O.CustomerId = Customer.Id
JOIN Employee
On O.EmployeeId = Employee.Id
